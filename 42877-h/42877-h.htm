<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p class="indent">A BOOK is judged by its peers.
In the presence of the greater
works of authors there is no
room for personal criticism;
they constitute in themselves
the perpetual mind of the race,
and dispense with any private
view. The eye rests on these hundred titles of
books famous in English literature, as it reads a
physical map by peak, river and coast, and sees
in miniature the intellectual conformation of a nation.
A different selection would only mean another
point of view; some minor features might be
replaced by others of similar subordination; but
the mass of imagination and learning, the mind-achievement
of the English race, is as unchangeable
as a mountain landscape. Perspective thrusts
its unconscious judgment upon the organs of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiv" id="pagexiv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xiv]</span>
sight, also; if Gower is thin with distance and the
clump of the Elizabethans shows crowded with
low spurs, the eye is not therefore deceived by
the large pettiness of the foreground with its more
numerous and distinct details. The mass governs.
Darwin appeals to Milton; Shelley is judged by
Pope, and Hawthorne by Congreve.</p>

<p class="indent">These books must of necessity be national books;
for fame, which is essentially the highest gift of
which man has the giving, cannot be conferred except
by a public voice. Fame dwells upon the lips
of men. It is not that memorable books must all
be people&#39;s books, though the greatest are such&mdash;the
Book of Common Prayer, the Bible, Shakespeare;
but those which embody some rare intellectual
power, or illuminate some seldom visited
tract of the spirit, or merely display some peculiar
taste in learning or pastime, must yet have something
racial in them, something public, to secure
their hold against the detaching power of time;
they must be English books, not in tongue only,
but body and soul. They are not less the books
of a nation because they are remote, superfine, uncommon.
Such are the books of the poets&mdash;the
Faërie Queene; books of the nobles&mdash;Arcadia;
books of the scholar&mdash;the Anatomy of Melancholy.
These books open the national genius as
truly, kind by kind, as books of knowledge exhibit
the nation&#39;s advancement in learning, stage by
stage, when new sciences are brought to the birth.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexv" id="pagexv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xv]</span>
The Wealth of Nations, Locke&#39;s Essay, Blackstone&#39;s
Commentaries, are not merely the product
of private minds. They are landmarks of English
intellect; and more, since they pass insensibly into
the power of civilization in the land, feeding the
general mind. The limited appeal that many classics
made in their age, and still make, indicates
lack of development in particular persons; but
however numerous such individuals may be, in
whatever majorities they may mass, the mind of
the race, once having flowered, has flowered with
the vigor of the stock. The Compleat Angler finds
a rustic breast under much staid cloth; Pepys was
never at a loss for a gossip since his seals were
broken, and Donne evokes his fellow-eccentric
whose hermitage is the scholar&#39;s bosom; but
whether the charm work on few or on many is indifferent,
for whom they affect, they affect through
consanguinity. The books of a nation are those
which are appropriate to its genius and embody
its variations amid the changes of time; even its
sports, like Euphues, are itself; and the works
which denote the evolution of its civilized life in
fructifying progress, whose increasing diversities
are yet held in the higher harmony of one race, one
temperament, one destiny, are without metaphor
its Sibylline books, and true oracles of empire.</p>

<p class="indent">It is a sign of race in literature that a book can
spare what is private to its author, and comes at
last to forgo his earth-life altogether.  This is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvi" id="pagexvi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xvi]</span>
obvious of works of knowledge, since positive
truth gains nothing from personality, but feels it
as an alloy; and a wise analysis will affirm the
same of all long-lived books. Works of science
are charters of nature, and submit to no human
caprice; and, in a similar way, works of imagination,
which are to the inward world of the spirit
what works of science are to the natural universe,
are charters of the soul, and borrow nothing from
the hand that wrote them. How deciduous such
books are of the private life needs only to be
stated to be allowed. They cast biography from
them like the cloak of the ascending prophet. An
author is not rightly to be reckoned among immortals
until he has been forgotten as a man, and
become a shade in human memory, the myth of
his own work. The anecdote lingering in the
Mermaid Tavern is cocoon-stuff, and left for
waste; time spiritualizes the soul it released in
Shakespeare, and the speedier the change, so
much the purer is the warrant of a life above
death in the minds of men. The loneliness of
antique names is the austerity of fame, and only
therewith do Milton, Spenser, Chaucer, seem nobly
clad and among equals; the nude figure of Shelley
at Oxford is symbolical and prophetic of this disencumberment
of mortality, the freed soul of the
poet,&mdash;like Bion, a divine form. Not to speak of
those greatest works, the Prayer Book, the Bible,
which seem so impersonal in origin as to be the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexvii" id="pagexvii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xvii]</span>
creation of the English tongue itself and the
genius of language adoring God; nor of Hakluyt
or Clarendon, whose books are all men&#39;s actions;
how little do the most isolated and seclusive
authors, Surrey, Collins, Keats, perpetuate except
the pure poet! In these hundred famous books
there are few valued for aught more than they
contain in themselves, or which require any other
light to read them by than what they bring with
them; they are rather hampered than helped by
the recollection of their authors&#39; careers. Sidney
adds lustre to the Arcadia; an exception among
men, in this as in all other ways, by virtue of that
something supereminent in him which dazzled his
own age. But who else of famous authors is
greater in his life than in his book? It is the
book that gives significance to the man, not the
man to the book. These authors would gain by
oblivion of themselves, and that in proportion to
their greatness, thereby being at once removed
into the impersonal region of man&#39;s permanent
spirit and of art. The exceptions are only seemingly
such; it is Johnson&#39;s thought and the style
of a great mind that preserve Boswell, not his
human grossness; and in Pepys it is the mundane
and every-day immortality of human nature, this
permanently curious and impertinent world, not
his own scandal and peepings, that yield him
allowance in libraries. In all books to which a nation
stands heir, it is man that survives,&mdash;the aspect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexviii" id="pagexviii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xviii]</span>
of an epoch, the phase of a religion, the mood
of a generation, the taste, sentiment, thought, pursuit,
entertainment, of a historic and diversified
people. There is nothing accidental in the fact
that of these hundred books forty-six bear no
author&#39;s name upon the title-page; nor is this due
merely to the eldest style of printing, as with
Chaucer, Gower, Malory, Langland; nor to the
inclusion of works by several hands&mdash;the Book
of Common Prayer, the Mirror for Magistrates,
the Tatler, the Spectator, the Reliques, the Federalist;
nor to the use of initials, as in the case
of Donne and Mrs. Browning. The characteristic
is constant. It is interesting to note the names
thus self-suppressed: Sackville, Spenser, Bacon,
Burton, Browne, Walton, Butler, Dryden, Locke,
Defoe, Swift, Pope, Richardson, Gray, Franklin,
Goldsmith, Sterne, Smollett, Sheridan, White,
Wordsworth, Irving, Austen, Scott, Lamb, Cooper,
Carlyle, Emerson, Brontë, Lowell, Tennyson,
George Eliot, Fitzgerald.</p>

<p class="indent">The broad and various nationality of English
literature is a condition precedent to greatness, and
underlies its mighty fortune. Its chief glory is its
continuity, by which it exceeds the moderns, and
must, with ages, surpass antiquity. Literary genius
has been so unfailing in the English race
that men of this blood live in the error that literature,
like light and air, is a common element in
the life of populations. Literature is really the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexix" id="pagexix"></a>[pg&nbsp;xix]</span>
work of selected nations, and with them is not a
constant product. Many nations have no literature,
and in fertile nations there are barren centuries.
The splendid perpetuity of Greek literature,
which covered two thousand years, was yet broken
by lean ages, by periods of desert dearth. In the
English, beginning from Chaucer (as is just, since
he is our Homer, whatever ages went before Troy
or Canterbury), there have been reigns without
a poet; and Greek example might prepare the
mind for Alexandrian and Byzantine periods in
the future, were it not for the grand combinations
of world-colonies and world-contacts which open
new perspectives of time for which the mind, as
part of its faith in life, requires destinies as large.
The gaps, however, were greatest at the beginning,
and grow less. One soil, one government,
one evenly unfolded civilization&mdash;long life
in the settled and peaceful land&mdash;contribute to this
continuity of literature in the English; but its explanation
lies in the integrity of English nurture,
and this is essentially the same in all persons of
English blood. Homer was not more truly the
school of Greece than the Bible has been the
school of the English. It has overcome all external
change in form, rule and institution, fused conventicle
and cathedral, and in dissolving separate
and narrow bonds of union has proved the greatest
bond of all, and become like a tie of blood. English
piety is of one stock, and through every book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexx" id="pagexx"></a>[pg&nbsp;xx]</span>
of holy living where its treasures are laid up, there
blows the breath of one Spirit. Herbert and
Bunyan are peers of a faith undivided in the hearts
of their countrymen.  It does not change, but is
the same yesterday, to-day and forever. On the
secular side, also, English nurture has been of
the like simple strain. The instinct of adventure,
English derring-do, has never failed. Holinshed
and Hakluyt were its chroniclers of old; and from
the Morte d&#39;Arthur to Sidney, from the Red-Cross
Knight to Ivanhoe, from Shakespeare&#39;s Henry to
Tennyson&#39;s Grenville, genius has not ceased to
stream upon it, a broad river of light. The Word
of God fed English piety; English daring was
fed upon the deeds of men. Hear Shakespeare&#39;s
Henry: &quot;Plutarch always delights me with a fresh
novelty. To love him is to love me; for he has
been long time the instructor of my youth. My
good mother, to whom I owe all, and who would
not wish, she said, to see her son an illustrious
dunce, put this book into my hands almost when
I was a child at the breast. It has been like my
conscience, and has whispered in my ear many
good suggestions and maxims for my conduct and
the government of my affairs.&quot; The English Plutarch
is written on the earth&#39;s face. Its battles
have named the lands and seas of all the world;
but, as was said of English piety, from Harold to
Cromwell, from the first Conqueror to Wellington,
from the Black Prince to Gordon, English
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxi" id="pagexxi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxi]</span>
daring&mdash;the strength of the yeoman, the breath
of the noble&mdash;is of one stock. Race lasts; those
who are born in the eyrie find eagles&#39; food. This
has planted iron resolution and all-hazarding
courage in epic-drama and battle-ode, and, as in
the old riddle, feeds on what it fed. English literature
is brave, martial, and brings forth men-children.
It has the clarion strength of empire; like
Taillefer at Hastings, Drayton and Tennyson still
lead the charge at Agincourt and Balaclava. As
Shakespeare&#39;s Henry was nourished, so was the
English spirit in all ages bred. This integrity of
English nurture, seen in these two great modes
of life turned toward God in the soul and toward
the world in action, is as plainly to be discerned
in details as in these generalities; and to state
only one other broad aspect of the facts governing
the continuity of literary genius in the English, but
one that goes to the foundations, the condition
that both vivifies and controls that genius in
law, metaphysics, science, in all political writing,
whether history, theory, or discussion, as well as
in the creative and artistic modes of its development,
is freedom. The freedom of England, which
is the parent of its greatness in all ways, is as
old in the race as fear of God and love of peril;
and, through its manifold and primary operation
in English nurture, is the true continuer of its
literature.</p>

<p class="indent">A second grand trait of English literature that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxii" id="pagexxii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxii]</span>
is writ large on these title-pages, is its enormous
assimilative power. So great is this that he who
would know English must be a scholar in all literatures,
and that with no shallow learning. The
old figure of the torch handed down from nation
to nation, as the type of man&#39;s higher life, gives
up its full meaning only to the student, and to him
it may come to seem that the torch is all and the
hand that bears it dust and ashes; often he finds
in its light only the color of his own studies, and
names it Greek, Semitic, Hindu, and looks on
English, French and Latin as mere carriers of the
flame. In so old a symbol there must be profound
truth, and it conveys the sense of antiquity in life,
of the deathlessness of civilization, and something
also of its superhuman origin&mdash;the divine gift of
fire transmitted from above; but civilization is
more than an inheritance, it is a power; and truth
is always more than it was; and wherever the torch
is lit, its light is the burning of a living race of
men. The dependence of the present on the past,
of a younger on an older people, of one nation on
another, is often misinterpreted and misleads; life
cannot be given, but only knowledge, example,
direction&mdash;influence, but not essence; and the impact
of one literature upon another, or of an old
historic culture upon a new and ungrown people,
is more external than is commonly represented.
The genius of a nation born to greatness is irresistible,
it remains itself, it does not become another.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiii" id="pagexxiii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxiii]</span>
The Greeks conquered Rome, men say,
through the mind; and Rome conquered the barbarians
through the mind; but in Gibbon who
finds Greece? and the mind of Europe does not
bear the ruling stamp of either Byzantine or
Italian Rome. In the narrowly temporal and personal
view, even under the overwhelming might
of Greece, Virgil remained, what Tennyson calls
him, &quot;Roman Virgil&quot;; and in the other capital instance
of apparently all-conquering literary power,
under the truth that went forth from Judea into all
lands, Dante remained Italian and Milton English.
Yet in these three poets, whose names are synonyms
of their countries, the assimilated element
is so great that their minds might be said to have
been educated abroad.</p>

<p class="indent">What is true of Milton is true of the young
English mind, from Chaucer and earlier. In the
beginning English literature was a part of European
literature, and held a position in it analogous
to that which the literature of America occupies in
all English speech; it was not so much colonial
as a part of the same world. The first works
were European books written on English soil;
Chaucer, Gower and Malory used the matter of
Europe, but they retained the tang of English, as
Emerson keeps the tang of America. The name
applied to Gower, &quot;the moral Gower,&quot; speaks him
English; and Arthur, &quot;the flower of kings,&quot;
remains forever Arthur of Britain; and the Canterbury
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxiv" id="pagexxiv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxiv]</span>
pilgrimage, whatever the source of the
world-wandering tales, gives the first crowded
scene of English life. In Langland, whose form
was mediæval, lay as in the seed the religious
and social history of a protestant, democratic, and
labor-honoring nation. In the next age, with
the intellectual sovereignty of humanism, Surrey,
Sackville, Lyly, Sidney and Spenser put all the
new realms of letters under tribute, and made
capture with a royal hand of whatever they would
have for their own of the world&#39;s finer wealth;
the dramatists gathered again the tales of all nations;
and, period following period, Italy, Spain
and France in turn, and the Hebrew, Greek and
Latin unceasingly, brought their treasures, light
or precious, to each generation of authors, until
the last great burst of the age now closing, itself
indebted most universally to all the past and all
the world. Yet each new wave that washed empire
to the land retreated, leaving the genius of
English unimpaired and richer only in its own
strength. Notwithstanding the <i>concettisti</i>, the
heroic drama, the Celtic mist, which passed like
shadows from the kingdom, the instinct of the
authors held to the massive sense of Latin and
the pure form of Greek and Italian, and constituted
these the enduring humane culture of English
letters and their academic tradition. The permanence
of this tradition in literary education has
been of vast importance, and is to the literary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxv" id="pagexxv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxv]</span>
class, in so far as they are separate by training,
what the integrity of English nurture at large has
been to the nation. The poets, especially, have
been learned in this culture; and, so far from being
self-sprung from the soil, were moulded into
power by every finer touch of time. Chaucer,
Spenser, Milton, Gray, Shelley, Tennyson are the
capital names that illustrate the toil of the scholar,
and approve the mastery of that classical culture
which has ever been the most fruitful in the
choicest minds. As on the broad scale English
literature is distinguished by its general assimilative
power, being hospitable to all knowledge, it
is most deeply and intimately, because continuously,
indebted to humane studies, in the strictest
sense, and has derived from them not, as in many
other cases, transitory matter and the fashion of
an hour, but the form and discipline of art itself. In
assimilating this to English nature, literary genius
incurred its greatest obligation, and in thereby discovering
artistic freedom found its greatest good.
This academic tradition has created English culture,
which is perhaps best described as an instinctive
standard of judgment, and is the necessary
complement to that openness of mind that has
characterized English literature from the first.
Nor is this last word a paradox, but the simple
truth, as is plain from the assimilative power here
dwelt upon. The English genius is always itself;
no element of greatness could inhere in it otherwise;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxvi" id="pagexxvi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxvi]</span>
but, in literature, it has had the most open
mind of any nation.</p>

<p class="indent">A third trait of high distinction in English literature,
of which this list is a reminder, and one
not unconnected with its continuity and receptivity,
is its copiousness. This is not a matter of mere
number, of voluminousness; there is an abundance
of kinds. In the literature of knowledge, what
branch is unfruitful, and in the literature of power,
what fountainhead is unstruck by the rod? Only
the Italian genius in its prime shows such supreme
equality in diversity. How many human interests
are exemplified, and how many amply illustrated,
exhibiting in a true sense and not by hyperbole
myriad-minded man! In the English genius there
seems something correspondent to this marvellous
efficacy of faculty and expression; it has largeness
of power. The trait most commonly thought of
in connection with Aristotle as an individual&mdash;&quot;master
of those who know&quot;&mdash;and in connection
with mediæval schoolmen as a class, is not less
characteristic of the English, though it appears
less. The voracity of Chaucer for all literary
knowledge, which makes him encyclopædic of a
period, is matched at the end of these centuries by
Newman, whose capaciousness of intellect was inclusive
of all he cared to know. Bacon, in saying,
&quot;I take all knowledge to be my province,&quot; did not
so much make a personal boast as utter a national
motto. The great example is, of course, Shakespeare,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxvii" id="pagexxvii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxvii]</span>
on whose universality later genius has
exhausted metaphor; but for everything that he
knew in little, English can show a large literature,
and exceeds his comprehensiveness.  The
fact is best illustrated by adverting to what this
list spares.  English is rich in translations, and
in this sort of exchange the balance of trade is
always in favor of the importer.  Homer alone is
included here,&mdash;to except the Bible, which has
been so inbred in England as to have become
an English book to an eye that clings to the truth
through all appearances; but how rich in great
national books is a literature that can omit so
noble a work, though translated, and one so historic
in English, as North&#39;s Plutarch!  In the
literature of knowledge, Greek could hardly have
passed over Euclid; but Newton&#39;s Principia is
here not required. Sir Thomas More is one of
the noblest English names, and his Utopia is
a memorable book; but it drops from the list.
Nor is it names and books only that disappear;
but, as these last instances suggest, kinds of
literature go out with them. Platonism falls into
silence with the pure tones of Vaughan, in whom
light seems almost audible; and the mystic Italian
fervor of the passional spirit fades with Crashaw.
The books of politeness, though descended from
Castiglione, depart with Chesterfield, perhaps from
some pettiness that had turned courtesy into etiquette;
and parody retires with Buckingham.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxviii" id="pagexxviii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxviii]</span>
Latin literature was almost rewritten in English
during the eighteenth century; but the traces
of it here are few. Of inadequate representation,
how slight is burlesque in Butler, and the presence
of Chevy Chase hardly compensates for
the absence of the war-ballad in Drayton and
Campbell. So it is with a hundred instances.
In another way of illustration, it is to be borne
in mind that each author appears by only one
title; and while it may be true that commonly
each finer spirit stores up his immortality in
some one book that is a more perfect vessel of
time, yet fecundity is rightly reckoned as a sign
of greatness and measure of it in the most, and the
production of many books makes a name bulk
larger. Mass counts, when in addition to quality;
and the greatest have been plentiful writers. No
praise can make Gray seem more than a remnant
of genius, and no qualification of the verdict can
deprive Dryden and Jonson of largeness. It belongs
to genius to tire not in creation, thereby
imitating the excess of nature flowing from unhusbanded
sources. Yet among these hundred
books, as in scientific classification, one example
must stand for all, except when some folio, like an
ark, comes to the rescue of a Beaumont and
Fletcher. This is cutting the diamond with itself.
But within these limits, narrowing circle within
circle, what a universe of man remains! Culture
after culture, epoch by epoch, are laid bare as in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxix" id="pagexxix"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxix]</span>
geologic strata,&mdash;mediæval tale and history, humanistic
form, the Shakespearian age, Puritan,
Cavalier, man scientific, reforming, reborn into a
new natural, political, artistic world, man modern;
and in every layer of imagination and learning
lies, whole and entire, a buried English age. It
is by virtue of its copiousness that English literature
is so representative, both of man&#39;s individual
spirit in its restless forms of apprehension and
embodiment, and of its historic formulation in
English progress as national power.</p>

<p class="indent">The realization of this long-lived, far-gathering,
abounding English literature, in these external
phases, leaves untouched its original force. Whence
is its germinating power,&mdash;what is this genius of
the English? It is the same in literature as in
all its other manifold manifestations, for man is
forever unitary and of one piece. Curiosity, which
is the distinction of progressive peoples, is perhaps
its initial and moving source. The trait which
has sent the English broadcast over the world
and mingled their history with the annals of all
nations is the same that has so blended their literature
with the history of all tongues. The acquisitive
power which has created the empire of the
English, with dominion on dominion, is parallel
with the faculty that assimilates past literatures
with the body of their literary speech. But curiosity
is only half the word. It is singular that
the first quality which occurs to the mind in connection
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxx" id="pagexxx"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxx]</span>
with the English is, almost universally
and often exclusively, their practicality. They are
really the most romantic of all nations; romanticism
is the other half of their genius, and supplements
that positive element of knowledge-hunting
or truth-seeking which is indicated by their endless
curiosity. Possibly the Elizabethan age is
generally thought of as a romantic period, as if it
were exceptional; and the romantic vigor of the
late Georgian period, though everywhere acknowledged,
is primarily regarded as more strictly a
literary and not a national characteristic in its
time; but, like all interesting history, English history
was continuously romantic. The days of the
crusaders, the Wars of the Roses and the French
wars were of the same strain in action and character,
in adventurous travel, in personal fate, in
contacts, as were the times of Shakespeare&#39;s world
or of the world of Waterloo. What a reinforcement
of character in the English has India been,
how restorative of greatness in the blood! It
must be that romanticism should characterize a
great race, and, when appealing to a positive
genius, the greatest race; for in it are all the invitations
of destiny. Futurity broods and brings
forth in its nest. Romanticism is the lift of life
in a people that does not merely continue, but
grows, spreads and overcomes. The sphere of
the word is not to be too narrowly confined, as
only a bookish phrase of polite letters.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxi" id="pagexxxi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxxi]</span>
In the world of knowledge the pursuit of truth is
romantic. The scientific inquirer lives in a realm
of strangeness and in the presence of the unknown,
in a place so haunted with profound feeling, so
electric with the emotions that feed great minds,
that whether awe of the unsolved or of the solved
be the stronger sentiment he cannot tell; and the
appeal made to him&mdash;to the explorer in every
bodily peril, to the experimenter in the den of untamed
forces, to the thinker in his solitude&mdash;is
often a romantic appeal. The moments of great
discoveries are romantic moments, as is seen in
Keats&#39;s sonnet, lifting Cortez and the star-gazer on
equal heights with the reader of the Iliad. The
epic of science is a Columbiad without end. Nor
is this less true of those branches of knowledge
esteemed most dry and prosaic. Locke, Adam
Smith, Darwin were all similarly placed with
Pythagoras, Aristotle and Copernicus; the mind,
society and nature, severally, were their Americas.
Even in this age of the mechanical application of
forces, which by virtue of the large part of these
inventions in daily and world-wide life seems
superficially, and is called, a materialistic age, romanticism
is paramount and will finally be seen so.
Are not these things in our time what Drake and
Spanish gold and Virginia, what Clive and the
Indies, were to other centuries? It is true that
the element of commercial gain blends with other
phases of our inventions, and seems a debasement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxii" id="pagexxxii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxxii]</span>
an avarice; but so it was in all ages. Nor
are the applications of scientific discovery for the
material ends of wealth other or relatively greater
now than the applications of geographical discovery,
for example, to the same ends were in
Elizabeth&#39;s reign and later. In the first ages
commercial gain was in league with the waves
from which rose the Odyssey,&mdash;a part of that
early trading, coasting world, as it was always
a part of the artistic world of Athens. Gain in
any of its material forms, whether wealth, power
or rank, does not debase the knowledge, the courage
of heart, the skill of hand and brain, from
which it flows, for it is their natural and proper
fruit; nor does it by itself materialize either the
man or the nation, else civilization were doomed
from the start, and the pursuit of truth would end
in humiliation and ignominy. It is rather the
attitude of mind toward this new world of knowledge
and this spectacle of man now imperializing
through nature&#39;s forces, as formerly through discovery
of the earth&#39;s lands and seas, that makes
the character of our age. Romanticism, being the
enveloping mood in whose atmosphere the spirit
of man beholds life, and, as it were, the light on
things, changes its aspect in the process of the
ages with the emergence of each new world of
man&#39;s era; and as it once inhered in English
loyalty and the piety of Christ&#39;s sepulchre, and
in English voyaging over-seas and colonizing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxiii" id="pagexxxiii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxxiii]</span>
of the lands, it now inheres in the conquest of
natural force for the arts of peace. The present
age exceeds its predecessors in marvel in proportion
as the victories of the intellect are in a world
of finer secrecy than any horizon veils, and build
an empire of greater breadth and endurance than
any monarch or sovereign people or domineering
race selfishly achieves; its victories are in
the unseen of force and thought, and it brings
among men the undecaying empire of knowledge,
as inexpugnable as the mind in man and as inappropriable
as light and air. Here, as elsewhere,
it is the sensual eye that sees the sensual thing,
but the spiritual eye spiritually discerns. It is
romance that adds this &quot;precious seeing&quot; to the
eye. Openness to the call, capability of the passion,
and character, so sensitized and moulded in individuals
and made hereditary in a civilization and
a race and idealized in conscience, constitute the
motor-genius of a nation, which is its finding faculty;
and the appreciation of results and putting
them to the use of men make its conserving and
positive power. These two, indistinguishably
married and blended, are the English genius. A
positive genius following a romantic lead, a romantic
genius yielding a positive good, equally
describe it from opposed points of view; yet in
the finer spirits and in the long age the romantic
temperament is felt to be the fertilizing element,
to be character as opposed to performance. Greatness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxiv" id="pagexxxiv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxxiv]</span>
lies always in the unaccomplished deed, as in
the lonely anecdote of Newton: &quot;I do not know
what I may appear to the world, but to myself I
seem to have been only like a boy playing on the
seashore, and diverting myself in now and then
finding a smoother pebble, or a prettier shell than
ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all
undiscovered before me.&quot; So Tennyson with his
&quot;wages of going on,&quot; and Sir John Franklin and
Gordon in their lives. This spiritual breath of the
nation in all its activities through centuries is the
breath of its literature, there embodied in its finer
being and applied to the highest uses for the civilization
and culture of the nation by truth and art.
In English literary history, and in its men of
genius taken individually, the positive or the romantic
may predominate, each in its own moment;
but the conspectus of the whole assigns to each its
true levels. Romanticism condensed in character,
which is the creation of the highest poetic genius,
the rarest work of man, has its illustrative example
in Shakespeare, the first of all writers; he
followed it through all its modes, and perhaps its
simplest types are Henry IV for action, Romeo
for passion, and Hamlet, which is the romance of
thought. Before Shakespeare, Spenser closed the
earliest age, which had been shaped by a diffused
romantic tradition, inherited from mediævalism,
though in its later career masked under Renaissance
forms; and since Shakespeare, a similar
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxv" id="pagexxxv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxxv]</span>
diffused romantic prescience, in the region of the
common life and of revolutionary causes most significantly,
brought in our age that has now passed
its first flower, but has yet long to run. These
are the three great ages of English poetry. In
the interval between the second and the third, the
magnificently accomplished school of the eighteenth
century gave to English an age of cultivated
repose, in which Pope, its best example,
lived on the incomes of the past, and, together
with the younger and the elder men he knew, exhibited
in literature that conserving and positive
power which is the economy of national genius;
but even in that great century, wherever the future
woke, there was a budding romanticism, in Collins,
Gray, Walpole, Thomson, Cowper, Blake.
Such was the history of English poetry, and the
same general statement will be found applicable
to English prose, though in a lower tone, due to
the nature of prose. Taken in the large, important
as the positive element in it is, the English
literary genius is, like the race, temperamentally
romantic, to the nerve and bone.</p>

<p class="indent">This view becomes increasingly apparent on examination
of the service of this literature to civilization
and the individual soul of man, which is the
great function of literature, and of its place in the
world of art.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How shall the world be served?&quot; was Chaucer&#39;s
question; and it has never been absent from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxvi" id="pagexxxvi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxxvi]</span>
any great mind of the English stock. The literature
of a nation, however, including, as here, books
of knowledge, is so nearly synonymous with the
mind in all its operations in the national life, as
to be coextensive with civilization, and hardly separable
from it. Civilization is cast in the mould of
thought, and retains the brute necessity of nature
only as mass, but not as surface; it is the flowering
of human forces in the formal aspect of life, and of
these literature is one mode, reflecting in its many
phases all the rest in their manifestations, and inwardly
feeding them in their vital principle. The
universality of its touch on life is indicated by the
fact that it has made the English a lettered people,
the alphabet as common as numbers, and the ability
to read almost as wide-spread in the race as
the ability to count. Its service, therefore, cannot
be summarized any more than the dictionary of
its words. It is possible to bring within the compass
of a paragraph only hints and guide-marks
of its work; and naturally these would be gathered
from its most comprehensive influences in the
higher spheres of intellect and morals, in the world
of ideas, and in the person of those writers who
were either the founders or restorers of knowledge.
Such a cardinal service was the Baconian method,
to take a single great instance, which may almost
be said to have reversed the logical habit of the
mind of Europe, and to have summoned nature
to a new bar. It is enough to name this. Of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxvii" id="pagexxxvii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxxvii]</span>
books powerful in intellectual results, Locke&#39;s
Essay is, perhaps, thought of as metaphysical
and remote, yet it was of immeasurable influence
at home and abroad, so subtly penetrating as to
resemble in scale and intimacy the silent forces of
nature. It was great as a representative of the
spirit of rationalism, which it supported and spread
with incalculable results on the temper of educated
Europe; and great also as a product and embodiment
of that cold, intellectual habit, distinctive of
a certain kind of English mind, and usually regarded
as radical in the race. It was great by the
variety as well as the range of its influence, and
was felt in all regions of abstract thought and those
practical arts, education, government and the like,
then most affected by such thought; it permanently
modified the cast of men&#39;s minds. In opposition
to it new philosophical movements found their
mainspring. A similar honor belongs to Adam
Smith&#39;s Wealth of Nations in another century.
It is customary to eulogize the pioneer, and to
credit the first openers of Californias with the
wealth of all the mines worked by later comers;
and, in this sense, the words of Buckle, that have
been placed opposite the title-page, are, perhaps,
to be taken: &quot;Adam Smith contributed more, by
the publication of this single work, towards the
happiness of men than has been effected by the
united abilities of all the statesmen and legislators
of whom history has preserved an authentic account.&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxviii" id="pagexxxviii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxxviii]</span>
But the excess of the statement is a proof
of the largeness of the truth it contains, and like-minded
praise is not from Buckle alone, but may
be found in half a score of thoughtful and temperate
authors. In the last age, Darwin, by his
Origin of Species, most arrested the attention of
the scientific mind, and stimulated the highly educated
world with surprise. He was classed with
Copernicus, as having brought man&#39;s pretension
to be the first of created things, and their lord
from the beginning, under the destroying criticism
of scientific time and its order, in the same
way that Copernicus brought the pretension of the
earth to be the centre of the universe under a like
criticism of scientific space and its order; and in
these proud statements there is some measure of
truth. The ideas of Darwin compel a readjustment
of man&#39;s thoughts with regard to his temporal
and natural relation to the universe in which
he finds himself; and the vast generalities of all
evolutionary thought received from Darwin immense
stimulus, its method greater scope, and its
results a firmer hold on the general mind, with an
influence still unfathomable upon man&#39;s highest
beliefs with regard to his origin and destiny.
There are epochs in the intellectual history of the
race as marked as those of the globe; and such
works as these, in the literature of knowledge,
show the times of the opening of the seals.</p>

<p class="indent">In addition to the service so done in the advancement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexxxix" id="pagexxxix"></a>[pg&nbsp;xxxix]</span>
of civilization by the discovery of new
truth, as great benefaction is accomplished by the
continual agitation and exercise of men&#39;s minds
in the ideas that are not new but the ever-living
inheritance from the past, whose permanence
through all epochs shows their deep grounding in
the race they nourish. In English such ideas are,
especially, in the view of the whole world, ideas
of civil and religious liberty in the widest sense
and particularly as worked out in legal and political
history. The common law of England in
Blackstone is a mighty legacy. On the large
public scale, and as involved in the constitutional
making of a great nation, the Federalist is a
document invaluable as setting forth essentials of
free government under a particular application;
and for comment on social liberty, Burke, on the
conservative, and Paine, on the radical side, exhibit
the scope, the weight and fire of English
thought. Of still greater significance, for the
mass and variety of teaching, is that commentary
on man&#39;s freedom which is contained in the operation
of liberty and its increase as presented in
the long story of England&#39;s greatness recorded
in the works of her historians from Holinshed
to Macaulay, with what the last prolific generation
has added. They are exceeded in the dignity
of their labors by Gibbon, whose work on
Rome, which Mommsen called the greatest of all
histories and is often likened to a mighty bridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexl" id="pagexl"></a>[pg&nbsp;xl]</span>
spanning the gulf between the ancient and the
modern world, was a contribution to European
learning; but the historians of English liberty
have more profitably served mankind. At yet
another remove, the ideas of liberty&mdash;and the mind
acquainted with English books is dazzled by the
vast comprehensiveness of such a phrase&mdash;are
again poured through the nation&#39;s life-blood by
all her poets, and well-nigh all her writers in prose,
in one or another mode of the Promethean fire.
These ideas are never silent, never quiescent;
they work in the substance, they shape the form
and feature, of English thought; they are the necessary
element of its being; they constitute the
race of freemen, and are known in every language
as English ideas. They give sublimity to the
figure of Milton; they are the feeding flame of
Shelley&#39;s mind; they alone lift Tennyson to an
eagle-flight of song. In the unceasing celebration
of ideal liberty, and its practical life in English
character and events, the literature of England
has, perhaps, done a greater service than in the
positive advancement of knowledge, for it is more
fundamental in the national life. Touching the
subject almost at random, such are a few of the
points of contact between English books and
the civilization of men.</p>

<p class="indent">It is still more difficult to state briefly the action
of literature on the individual for what is more
distinctly his private gain, in the enlargement of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexli" id="pagexli"></a>[pg&nbsp;xli]</span>
his life, the direction of his thoughts, and bringing
him into harmony with the world. As, in regard
to civilization, the emphasis lay rather on the literature
of knowledge, here it lies on the literature
of power,&mdash;on imaginative and reflective works.
Its initial office is educative; it feeds the imagination
and the powers of sympathy, and trains not
only the affections but all feeling; and in these
fields it is the only instrument of education outside
of real experience. It is this that gives it such
primacy as to make acquaintance with humane
letters almost synonymous with culture. No actual
world is large enough for a man to live in;
at the lowest, there is some tradition of the past,
some expectation of the future; and, though training
in the senses is an important part of early
life, yet the greater part of education consists in
putting the young in possession of an unseen
world. The biograph is a marvellous toy of the
time, but literature in its lower forms of information,
of history, travel and description, has been a
biograph for the mind&#39;s eye from the beginning;
and in its higher forms of art it performs a greater
service by bringing into mental vision what it is
above the power of nature to produce. To expand
the mind to the compass of space and time,
and to people these with the thoughts of mankind,
to revive the past and penetrate the reality of the
present, is the joint work of all literature; and as
a preparation for individual life, in unfolding the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlii" id="pagexlii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xlii]</span>
faculties and the feelings, humane letters achieve
their most essential task. Literature furnishes the
gymnasia for all youth, in that part of their nature
in which the highest power of humanity lies.
But this is only, as was said, its initial office.
Throughout life it acts in the same way on old
and young alike. The dependence of all men on
thought, and of thought on speech, is a profound
matter, though as little considered as gravitation
that keeps the world entire; and the speech on
which such a strain of life lies is the speech
of books. How has Longfellow consoled middle
life in its human trials, how has Carlyle roused
manhood, and Emerson illumined life for his
readers at every stage! Scott is a benefactor of
millions by virtue of the entertainment he has
given to English homes and the lonely hours of
his fellow-men, now for three generations, to an
extent hardly measurable in thought; and so in
hardly a less degree is Dickens, and, though diminishing
in inclusive power, are Thackeray, Austen,
Brontë, Cooper, Hawthorne, George Eliot, to
name only novelists. Each century has had its
own story-telling from Chaucer down, though
masked in the Elizabethan period as drama, and
in each much hearty and refined pleasure has
been afforded by the spectacle of life in books;
but in the last age the benefit so conferred is to be
reckoned among the greater blessings of civilization.
It is singular that humor, so prime and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexliii" id="pagexliii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xliii]</span>
constant a factor in English, should have so few
books altogether its own, and these not of the
greater class; but the spirit which yields burlesque
in Butler and Irving, and comedy in Massinger,
Congreve and Sheridan, pervades the body of
English literature and characterizes it among national
literatures. The highest mind is incomplete
without humor, for a perfect idealism includes
laughter at the real; and it is natural, for, the
principle of humor being incongruity to the intellect,
it is properly most keen in those in whom
the idea of order, which is the mother-idea of the
intellect, is most omnipresent and controlling;
but as humor is thus auxiliary in character, it is
found to be subordinate also in English literature
as a whole. The constancy of its presence, however,
is a sign of the general health of the English
genius, which has turned to morbidity far
less than that of other nations ancient or modern.
It is a cognate fact, here, that great books
are never frivolous; they leave the reader wiser
and better, as well through laughter as through
tears, or they sustain imaginative and sympathetic
power already acquired. They open the world
of humanity to the heart, and they open the
heart to itself. In another region, not primarily
of entertainment, the value of literature lies in
its function to inspire. In individual life, each
finer spirit of the past touches with an electric
force those of his own kindred as they are born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexliv" id="pagexliv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xliv]</span>
into the world of letters, and often for life. The
later poets have most personal power in this way.
Burns, Wordsworth, Byron, Shelley have been
the inspiration of lives, like Carlyle and Emerson
in prose. The most intense example of national
inspiration in a book is Uncle Tom&#39;s Cabin; but
in quieter ways Scotland feels the pulse of Burns,
and England the many-mingled throbbing of the
poets in her blood.</p>

<p class="indent">On the large scale, in the impact of literature
on the individual soul and through that on the national
belief, aspiration and resolve, the great sphere
of influence lies necessarily in the religious life,
because that is universal and constant from birth
to death and spreads among the secret springs
and sources of man&#39;s essential nature. It is a
commonplace, it has sometimes been made a reproach,
that English literature is predominantly
moral and religious, and the fact is plainly so.
The strain that began with Piers Plowman flourished
more mightily in the Pilgrim&#39;s Progress.
The psalm-note that was a tone of character in
Surrey, Wyatt and Sidney gave perfect song in
Milton, both poet and man. From Butler to
Newman the intellect, applied to religion, did not
fail in strenuous power. Taylor&#39;s Holy Living
is a saint&#39;s book. If religious poets, of one pure
strain of Sabbath melody, have been rare, yet
Herbert, Vaughan, Cowper, Keble, Whittier are
to the memory Christian names, with the humility
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlv" id="pagexlv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xlv]</span>
and breathing peace of sacred song. The portion
of English literature expressly religious is enlarged
by the works of authors, both in prose and
verse, in which religion was an occasional theme
and often greatly dealt with; and the religious
and moral influence of the body of literature as a
whole on the English race is immensely increased
by those writers into whom the Christian spirit
entered as a master-light of reason and imagination,
such as Spenser in the Faërie Queene and
Wordsworth in his works generally, or Gray in
the solemn thought of the Elegy. To particularize
is an endless task; for the sense of duty
toward man and God is of the bone and flesh of
English books in every age, being planted in
the English nature. This vast mass of experience
and counsel, of praise and prayer, of insight and
leading, variously responding to every phase of
the religious consciousness of the historic people,
has been, like the general harvest, the daily food
of the nation in its spiritual life. If Shakespeare
is the greatest of our writers, the English Bible is
the greatest of our books; and the whole matter
is summarized in saying that the Bible, together
with the Book of Common Prayer, is the most
widely distributed, the most universally influential,
the most generally valued and best-read book
of the English people, and this has been true since
the diffusion of printing. It may seem only the
felicity of time that the English language best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlvi" id="pagexlvi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xlvi]</span>
adorns its best book; but it is by a higher blessing
that English character centres in this Book,
that English thinkers see by it, that English poets
feel by it, that the English people live by it; for
it has passed into the blood of all English veins.</p>

<p class="indent">It is natural to inquire, after dwelling so much
on the practical power of English literature in
society and life, what is its value in the world
of art, in that sphere where questions of perfection
in the form, of permanence in the matter,
and the like, arise. If the standards of an academic
classicism be applied, English literature will
fall below both Latin and Greek, and the Italian
and French, and take a lower place with German
and Spanish, to which it is most akin. But such
standards are pseudo-classical at best, and under
modern criticism find less ground in the ancients.
The genius of the English is romantic, and originated
romantic forms proper to itself, and by these
it should be judged. The time is, perhaps, not
wholly gone by when the formlessness of Shakespeare
may be found spoken of as a matter of
course, as the formlessness of Shelley is still generally
alleged; but if neither of these has form in
the pseudo-classic, the Italian and French, sense
of convention, decorum and limit, they were creators
of that romantic form in which English, together
with Spanish, marks the furthest original
modern advance. The subject is too large, and
too much a matter of detail, for this place; but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlvii" id="pagexlvii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xlvii]</span>
it is the less necessary to expand it, for it is as
superfluous to establish the right of Shakespeare
in the realm of the most perfect art as to examine
the title-deeds of Alexander&#39;s conquests.  He
condensed romanticism in character, as was said
above; and in the power with which he did this,
in the wisdom, beauty and splendor of his achievement,
excelled all others, both for substance and
art. The instinct of fame may be safely followed
in assigning a like primacy to Milton. The moment
which Milton occupied, in the climax of a
literary movement, is, perhaps, not commonly observed
with accuracy. The drama developed out
of allegorical and abstract, and through historical,
into entirely human and ideal forms; and in
Shakespeare this process is completed. The same
movement, on the religious as opposed to the secular
line, took place more slowly. Spenser, like
Sackville, works by impersonation of moral qualities,
viewed abstractly; the Fletchers, who carried
on his tradition, employ the same method, which
gives a remote and often fantastic character to
their work; nor was moral and religious poetic narrative
truly humanized, and given ideal power in
character and event, until Milton carried it to its
proper artistic culmination in Paradise Lost. Milton
stands to the evolution of this branch of poetic
literature, springing from the miracle-plays, precisely
as Shakespeare does to the branch of ideal
drama; and thus, although he fell outside of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlviii" id="pagexlviii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xlviii]</span>
great age, and was sixty years later than Shakespeare
in completing the work, the singularity of
his literary greatness, his loneliness as a lofty genius
in his time, becomes somewhat less inexplicable.
The Paradise Lost occupies this moment of
climax, to repeat the phrase, in literary history, and,
like nearly all works in such circumstances, it has a
greatness all its own. But, beyond that, it lies in
a region of art where no other English work companions
it, as an epic of the romantic spirit such as
Italy most boasts of, but superior in breadth, in
ethical power, in human interest, to Ariosto or
Tasso, and comparing with them as Pindar with
the Alexandrians; it realized Hell and Eden, and
the world of heavenly war and the temptation, to the
vision of men, with tremendous imaginative power,
stamping them into the race-mind as permanent
imagery; and the literary kinship which the workmanship
bears to what is most excellent and shining
in the great works of Greece, Rome and Italy,
as well as to Hebraic grandeur, helps to place the
poem in that remoter air which is an association
of the mind with all art. No other English poem
has a similar brilliancy, aloofness and perfection,
as of something existing in another element, except
the Adonais. In it personal lyricism achieved the
most impersonal of elegies, and mingled the fairest
dreams of changeful imaginative grief with the
soul&#39;s intellectual passion for immortality full-voiced.
It is detached from time and place; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexlix" id="pagexlix"></a>[pg&nbsp;xlix]</span>
hunger of the soul for eternity, which is its substance,
human nature can never lay off; its literary
kinship is with what is most lovely in the
idyllic melody of the antique; and, owing to its
small scale and the simple unity of its mood, it
gives forth the perpetual charm of literary form in
great purity. These two poems stand alone with
Shakespeare&#39;s plays, and are for epic and lyric
what his work is for drama, the height of English
performance in the cultivation of romance. Other
poets must be judged to have attained excellence
in romantic art in proportion as they reveal the
qualities of Shakespeare, Milton and Shelley; for
these three are the masters of romantic form, which,
being the spirit of life proceeding from within
outward, is the vital structure of English poetic
genius. This internal power is also a principle
of classic art in its antique examples; but academic
criticism developed from them a hardened formalism
to which romantic art is related as the spirit
of life to the death-mask of the past. Such pallor
has from time to time crossed the features of
English letters in a man or an age, and has
brought a marble dignity, as to Landor, or the
shadow of an Augustan elegance, as in the era of
Pope; but it has faded and passed away under
the flush of new life. Even in prose, in which
so-called classic qualities are still sought by academic
taste, the genius of English has shown a
native obstinacy. The novel is so Protean in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagel" id="pagel"></a>[pg&nbsp;l]</span>
form as to seem amorphous, but essentially repeats
the drama, and submits in its masters to Shakespearian
parallelism; in substance and manner it
has been overwhelmingly of a romantic cast; and
in the other forms of prose, style, though of all
varieties, has, perhaps, proved most preservative
when highly colored, individualized, and touched
with imaginative greatness, as in Browne, Taylor,
Milton, Bunyan, Burke, Carlyle, Macaulay; but
the inferiority of their matter, it should be observed,
affects the endurance of the eighteenth-century
prose masters&mdash;Steele, Addison, Swift and
Johnson, to name the foremost. Commonly, it
must be allowed, English, both prose and poetry,
notwithstanding its triumphs, is valued for substance
and not for form, whether this be due to a
natural incapacity, or to a retardation in development
which may hereafter be overcome, or to
the fact that the richness of the substance renders
the fineness of the form less eminent.</p>

<p class="indent">In conclusion, the thought rises of itself, will
this continuity, assimilative power, and copiousness,
this original genius, this serviceableness to
civilization and the private life, this supreme romantic
art, be maintained, now that the English
and their speech are spread through the world, or
is the history of the intellectual expansion of Athens
and Rome, the moral expansion of Jerusalem,
to be repeated? The saying of Shelley, &quot;The mind
in creation is a fading coal,&quot; seems to be true of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pageli" id="pageli"></a>[pg&nbsp;li]</span>
nations. Great literatures, or periods in them,
have usually marked the culmination of national
power; and if they &quot;look before and after,&quot; as
Virgil in the Æneid, they gather their wisdom, as
he too did, by a gaze reverted to the past. The
paradox of progress, in that the <i>laudator temporis
acti</i> is always found among the best and noblest
of the elders, while yet the whole world of man
ever moves on to greater knowledge, power and
good, continues like the riddle of the Sphinx;
but time seems unalterably in favor of mankind
through all dark prophecies. The mystery of
genius is unsolved; and the Messianic hope that
a child may be born unto the people always remains;
but the greatness of a nation dies only
with that genius which is not a form of human
greatness in individuals, but is shared by all of
the blood, and constitutes them fellow-countrymen.
The genius of the English shows no sign
of decay; age has followed age, each more gloriously,
and whether the period that is now closing
be really an end or only the initial movement of a
vaster arc of time, corresponding to the greater
English destiny, world-wide, world-peopling,
world-freeing, the arc of the movement of democracy
through the next ages,&mdash;is immaterial; so
long as the genius of the people, its piety and daring,
its finding faculty for truth, its creative shaping
in art, be still integral and vital, so long as its
spiritual passion be fed from those human and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="pagelii" id="pagelii"></a>[pg&nbsp;lii]</span>
divine ideas whose abundance is not lessened, and
on those heroic tasks which a world still half
discovered and partially subdued opens through
the whole range of action and of the intellectual
and moral life,&mdash;so long as these things endure,
English speech must still be fruitful in great ages
of literature, as in the past these have been its
fountainheads. But if no more were to be
written on the page of English, yet what is written
there, contained and handed down in famous
books and made the spiritual food of the vast multitude
whose children&#39;s children shall use and read
the English tongue through coming centuries
under every sky, will constitute a moral dominion
to which Virgil&#39;s line may proudly apply&mdash;</p>

<p class="margin-left4">The author of Piers Ploughman, no doubt,
embodied in a poetic dress just what millions
felt. His poem as truly expressed the popular
sentiment on the subjects it discussed
as did the American Declaration of Independence
the national thought and feeling on the
relations between the Colonies and Great Britain.
Its dialect, its tone and its poetic dress
alike conspired to secure to the Vision a
wide circulation among the commonalty of the
realm, and by formulating&mdash;to use a favorite
word of the day&mdash;sentiments almost universally
felt, though but dimly apprehended,
it brought them into distinct consciousness,
and thus prepared the English people for the
reception of the seed which the labors of
Wycliffe and his converts were already sowing
among them.</p>

Italie, and there tasted the sweete and
stately measures and stile of Italian Poesie,
as novices newly crept out of the schooles
of Dante, Arioste, and Petrarch, they
greatly pollished our rude and homely
maner of vulgar Poesie, from that it had
bene before, and for that cause may justly
be sayd the first reformers of our English

<p class="margin-left4">They contain the heroic tales of the exploits of the
great men in whom the new era was inaugurated;
not mythic like the Iliads and the Eddas, but plain,
broad narratives of substantial facts, which rival
legend in interest and grandeur. What the old
epics were to the royally or nobly born, this modern
epic is to the common people. We have no
longer kings or princes for chief actors to whom
the heroism, like the dominion of the world, had
in time past been confined. But, as it was in the
days of the Apostles, when a few poor fishermen
from an obscure lake in Palestine assumed, under
the Divine Mission, the spiritual authority over
mankind, so, in the days of our own Elizabeth,
the seamen from the banks of the Thames and the
Avon, the Plym and the Dart, self-taught and
self-directed, with no impulse but what was beating
in their own royal hearts, went out across the
unknown seas, fighting, discovering, colonizing,
and graved out the channels, paving them at last
with their bones, through which the commerce
and enterprise of England has flowed out over all
the world.</p>

<p class="margin-left4">To me Massinger is one of the most
interesting as well as one of the most
delightful of the old dramatists, not so
much for his passion or power, though
at times he reaches both, as for the
love he shows for those things that
are lovely and of good report in human
nature, for his sympathy with what
is generous and high-minded and honorable
and for his equable flow of a
good every-day kind of poetry, with
few rapids or cataracts, but singularly
soothing and companionable.</p>

<p class="margin-left4">Ford was of the first order of poets. He
sought for sublimity, not by parcels in
metaphors or visible images, but directly
where she has her full residence in the
heart of man; in the actions and sufferings
of the greatest minds. There is a
grandeur of the soul above mountains,
seas, and the elements. Even in the poor
perverted reason of Giovanni and Annabella
we discover traces of that fiery particle,
which in the irregular starting from
out of the road of beaten action, discovers
something of a right line even in obliquity,
and shows hints of an improvable greatness
in the lowest descents and degradation
of our nature.</p>

<p class="margin-left4">Sir, I pray deliver this little book
to my dear brother Farrar, and tell
him he shall find in it a picture of
the many spiritual conflicts that
have passed betwixt God and my
soul, before I would subject mine
to the will of Jesus, my Master, in
Whose service I have now found
perfect freedom. Desire him to
read it; and then, if he can think
it may turn to the advantage of any
dejected poor soul, let it be made
public; if not, let him burn it; for
I and it are less than the least of
God&#39;s mercies.</p>

very great check to! how much countenance they
have added to Virtue and Religion! how many
people they have rendered happy, by showing
them it was their own fault if they were not so!
and lastly how entirely they have convinced our
young fops and young fellows of the value and
advantages of Learning! He has indeed rescued
it out of the hands of pedants, and fools, and discovered
the true method of making it amiable and
lovely to all mankind. In the dress he gives it,
it is a most welcome guest at tea-tables and

a mild or cholerick Disposition, Married or a
Batchelor, with other Particulars of the like
nature, that conduce very much to the right Understanding
of an Author. To gratify this Curiosity,
which is so natural to a Reader, I design this
Paper, and my next, as Prefatory Discourses to my
following Writings, and shall give some Account
in them of the several Persons that are engaged in
this Work. As the chief Trouble of Compiling,
Digesting and Correcting will fall to my Share, I
must do my self the Justice to open the Work
with my own History.</p>

<p class="indent">I was born to a small Hereditary Estate, which
I find, by the Writings of the Family, was bounded
by the same Hedges and Ditches in <i>William</i> the
Conqueror&#39;s Time that it is at present, and has
been delivered down from Father to Son whole
and entire, without the Loss or Acquisition of a
single Field or Meadow, during the Space of six
hundred Years. There goes a Story in the Family,
that when my Mother was gone with Child of me
about three Months, she dreamt that she was brought
to Bed of a Judge: Whether this might proceed
from a Law-Suit which was then depending in
the Family, or my Father&#39;s being a Justice of
the Peace, I cannot determine; for I am not so
vain as to think it presaged any Dignity that I should
arrive at in my future Life, though that was the
Interpretation which the Neighbourhood put upon
it. The Gravity of my Behaviour at my very first
Appearance in the World, and all the Time that I
sucked, seemed to favour my Mother&#39;s Dream:
For, as she has often told me, I threw away my
Rattle before I was two Months old, and would
not make use of my Coral &#39;till they had taken
away the Bells from it.</p>

<p class="indent">As for the rest of my Infancy, there being nothing
in it remarkable, I shall pass it over in Silence.
I find that, during my Nonage, I had the Reputation
of a very sullen Youth, but was always a
Favourite of my School-Master, who used to say,
<i>that my Parts were solid and would wear well</i>. I
had not been long at the University, before I distinguished
my self by a most profound Silence: For,
during the Space of eight Years, excepting in
the publick Exercises of the College, I scarce uttered
the Quantity of an hundred Words; and indeed
do not remember that I ever spoke three Sentences
together in my whole Life. Whilst I was
in this Learned Body I applied my self with so
much Diligence to my Studies, that there are very
few celebrated Books, either in the Learned or the
Modern Tongues, which I am not acquainted
with.</p>

<p class="indent">Upon the Death of my Father I was resolved
to travel into Foreign Countries, and therefore
left the University, with the Character of an odd
unaccountable Fellow, that had a great deal of
Learning, if I would but show it. An insatiable
Thirst after Knowledge carried me into all the
Countries of <i>Europe</i>, where there was any thing
new or strange to be seen; nay, to such a Degree
was my Curiosity raised, that having read the Controversies
of some great Men concerning the Antiquities
of <i>Egypt</i>, I made a Voyage to <i>Grand
Cairo</i>, on purpose to take the Measure of a Pyramid;
and as soon as I had set my self right in that
Particular, returned to my Native Country with
great Satisfaction.</p>

<p class="indent">I have passed my latter Years in this City, where
I am frequently seen in most publick Places, tho&#39;
there are not above half a dozen of my select
Friends that know me; of whom my next Paper
shall give a more particular Account. There is
no Place of publick Resort, wherein I do not often
make my Appearance; sometimes I am seen thrusting
my Head into a Round of Politicians at <i>Will</i>&#39;s,
and listning with great Attention to the Narratives that
are made in those little Circular Audiences. Sometimes
I smoak a Pipe at <i>Child</i>&#39;s; and whilst I seem
attentive to nothing but the <i>Post-Man</i>, over-hear
the Conversation of every Table in the Room. I
appear on <i>Sunday Nights</i> at <i>St. James&#39;s Coffee</i>-House,
and sometimes join the little Committee
of Politicks in the Inner-Room, as one who comes
there to hear and improve. My Face is likewise
very well known at the <i>Grecian</i>, the <i>Cocoa-Tree</i>,
and in the Theaters both of <i>Drury-Lane</i>, and the
<i>Hay-Market</i>. I have been taken for a Merchant</p>

<p class="margin-left4">It breathes throughout a spirit of piety and
benevolence; it sets in a very striking light
the importance of the mechanic arts, which
they who know not what it is to be without
them are apt to undervalue. It fixes in the
mind a lively idea of the horrors of solitude,
and, consequently, of the sweets of social
life, and of the blessings we derive from conversation
and mutual aid; and it shows how
by labouring with one&#39;s own hands, one may
secure independence, and open for one&#39;s self
many sources of health and amusement. I
agree, therefore, with Rousseau, that this is
one of the best books that can be put into
the hands of children.</p>

<p class="margin-left4">It was about this date, I suppose, that I read
Bishop Butler&#39;s <i>Analogy</i>; the study of which
has been to so many, as it was to me, an era
in their religious opinions. Its inculcation of
a visible church, the oracle of truth and a
pattern of sanctity, of the duties of external
religion, and of the historical character of
Revelation, are characteristics of this great
work which strike the reader at once; for
myself, if I may attempt to determine what
I most gained from it, it lay in two points
which I shall have an opportunity of dwelling
on in the sequel: they are the underlying
principles of a great portion of my teaching.</p>

<p class="margin-left4">I received one morning a message from poor
Goldsmith that he was in great distress, and, as
it was not in his power to come to me, begging
that I would come to him as soon as possible. I
sent him a guinea, and promised to come to him
directly. I accordingly went as soon as I was
dressed, and found that his landlady had arrested
him for his rent, at which he was in a violent
passion. I perceived that he had already changed
my guinea, and had got a bottle of madeira and
a glass before him. I put the cork into the bottle,
desired he would be calm, and began to talk to
him of the means by which he might be extricated.
He then told me he had a novel (<i>The
Vicar of Wakefield</i>) ready for the press, which
he produced to me. I looked into it, and saw its
merit; told the landlady I should soon return;
and, having gone to a bookseller, sold it for sixty
pounds. I brought Goldsmith the money, and he
discharged his rent, not without rating his landlady
in a high tone for having used him so ill.</p>

principles of free government that is to
be compared, in instruction, and intrinsic
value, to this small and unpretending
volume of <i>The Federalist</i>, not even if
we resort to Aristotle, Cicero, Machiavel,
Montesquieu, Milton, Locke, or Burke.
It is equally admirable in the depth of
its wisdom, the comprehensiveness of
its views, the sagacity of its reflections,
and the fearlessness, patriotism, candor,
simplicity, and elegance with which its
truths are uttered and recommended.</p>

<p class="margin-left4">I read again, and for the third time, Miss
Austen&#39;s very finely written novel of <i>Pride
and Prejudice</i>. That young lady had a
talent for describing the involvements, feelings,
and characters of ordinary life, which
is to me the most wonderful I have ever
met with. The big bow-wow I can do
myself like any one going; but the exquisite
touch, which renders commonplace
things and characters interesting from the
truth of the description and the sentiment,
is denied me. What a pity so gifted a
creature died so early!</p>

and the closer we look, the more nearly we
arrive at this conclusion, that the <i>Elia</i> on
our shelves is all but the same being as the
pleasant Charles who was so loved by his
friends, who ransomed from the stalls, to
use old Richard of Bury&#39;s phrase, his
Thomas Browne and the &quot;dear silly old
angel&quot; Fuller, and who stammered out such
quaint jests and puns&mdash;&quot;Saint Charles,&quot;

<p class="margin-left4">Carlyle alone with his wide humanity has, since
Coleridge, kept to us the promises of England.
His provokes rather than informs. He blows
down narrow walls, and struggles, in a lurid light,
like the Jótuns, to throw the old woman Time;
in his work there is too much of the anvil and the
forge, not enough hay-making under the sun.
He makes us act rather than think; he does not
say, know thyself, which is impossible, but know
thy work. He has no pillars of Hercules, no
clear goal, but an endless Atlantis horizon. He
exaggerates. Yes: but he makes the hour great,
the future bright, the reverence and admiration
strong: while mere precise fact is a coil of lead.</p>

<p class="margin-left4">When all is said, Poe remains a master
of fantastic and melancholy sound. Some
foolish old legend tells of a musician who
surpassed all his rivals. His strains were
unearthly sad, and ravished the ears of
those who listened with a strange melancholy.
Yet his viol had but a single
string, and the framework was fashioned
out of a dead woman&#39;s breast-bone. Poe&#39;s
verse&mdash;the parallel is much in his own
taste&mdash;resembles that player&#39;s minstrelsy.</p>

<p class="margin-left4">There is a man in our own days whose words are
not framed to tickle delicate ears; who, to my
thinking, comes before the great ones of society
much as the son of Imlah came before the throned
Kings of Judah and Israel; and who speaks truth
as deep, with a power as prophet-like and as vital&mdash;a
mien as dauntless and as daring. Is the
satirist of <i>Vanity Fair</i> admired in high places?&mdash;They
say he is like Fielding; they talk of his wit,
humour, comic powers. He resembles Fielding
as an eagle does a vulture: Fielding could stoop
on carrion, but Thackeray never does. His wit
is bright, his humour attractive, but both bear the
same relation to his serious genius that the mere
lambent sheet-lightning, playing under the edge
of the summer cloud, does to the electric death-spark
hid in its womb.</p>

Works of imagination written with

commonly ephemeral; but the creative

overpowered the narrow specialty
